---Header -> fixed 16 bytes
Magic (int32):0x00444E42 (BND)
Version? (int32): must be a version value
Info Offset (int32): jumps to 0x10 (not a ideal name but just a made up one)
Table Offset (int32): jumps to 0x20 (table of contents area.)

--- Info Offset -> fixed 16 bytes
Entry Info Area/Start Point (int32): information on Entry Info starting point
Chunks (int32): jumps to where all data is stored
Padding (8 bytes): probably used in game. so skipping it.


Tables Section (Table of Content/TOC) area [0x20]
--- Table Offset
Total files (int32): all files, excluding directories
Total entries (int32): all entries, including dirs
[
  Hash (uint32): checksum value, crc32. used for both directory and filename (strings)
  Entry Info Offset (int32): pointer to an entry info section
  File Offset (int32)
  File Size (int32)
]

--- Entry Info Offset
???: 3 bytes of unknown data
Entry Offset (int32): just a pointer back that goes to itself in the table section
Filename (string):  read until null terminated (utf-8)


--- Reading Hash (sorting, useful on where to put files on extraction)
use crc32 checking to match directory + filename
? [directory string] + [filename string] + [entry hash value] = [result]
? bad result?, try to use other directory string until you find a match
